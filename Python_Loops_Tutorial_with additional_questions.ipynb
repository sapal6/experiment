Both keywords make it harder for others -including yourself in a couple of months when you look back to your code- to understand the control flow in the loop and where the condition ends. Additionally, you don't *need* to use the `break` and `continue` keywords: as you have seen up until now, you were doing perfectly fine without them! \n",
