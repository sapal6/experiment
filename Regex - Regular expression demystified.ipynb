    "Regular expressions or REGEX can be defined as a sequence of characters that can be used to define a pattern. In other other words regular expressions can also be defined as a shorthand representation of any pattern that you are trying to serach in a string of characters, text file , excel sheet etc. While working with data science problems many times you may need to extract specific chunks of data from already exisiting sequence of strings or from a text file or a dataframe. In this tutorial you will what Regex are & how to use it in your datascience pipeline."
